# kippo-log-parser
Parses the log files of a kippo honeypot for the interesting parts.

# How to use
Copy your kippo-log into the same folder as the parser file and run it using python 3.

The output.txt contains the parts of the log files with successful logins, the ips.txt shows which ip logged in how many times.
